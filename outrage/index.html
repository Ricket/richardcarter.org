<h1>Outrage!</h1>
<p>To play the game, run <a href="Outrage.application">this file</a> (preferably from Internet Explorer).</p>
<p><b>Instructions:</b> After clicking the Play button, click and drag your mouse downward and let go to send the dog flying (the original idea was to pull the dog's tail and let go). Hold down the spacebar to make the dog stick to the bouncy blocks. Try to collect all of the items in each level!</p>
<p>If you can't load the game because your .NET version is outdated or something, then use this <a href="setup.exe">setup.exe</a> file, which will install anything your computer might need along with the game.</p>
<p>If you're on Mac or Linux, you're out of luck. Install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows7">Windows</a>.</p>
