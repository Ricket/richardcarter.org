My personal website is at [RichardCarter.org](http://www.richardcarter.org/). I intend on replacing the content there by this project, which uses [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/) to generate HTML output, given my own custom build rules. So far it's been a very long-term project, and I have overall had little motivation to complete it due to the fact that, well, my website already exists (and is pretty neat, if you ask me).

You can see a recent build (generated from running the `nanoc` command on a clean checkout of this project) here:

Someday I hope to actually complete this and move the generated output into richardcarter.org. I hope to use it not only to generate the static portions of my site, but also to generate my blog as static HTML, allowing me to write my blog posts in Markdown. The initial motivation came from my Wordpress blog getting hacked.

To be honest, I most likely won't get around to actually finishing/deploying this until my current web hosting contract runs out, which is in Spring 2013. In the meantime, it's a fun ongoing project!
